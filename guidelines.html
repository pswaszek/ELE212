Proper technical communication of engineering work is essential for success.  
As an engineer, submitting sloppy, incomplete, and/or disorganized work is a quick 
way to damage your image and can lead to inaccurate and unsafe designs; it is 
therefore important for students to develop good communication habits early in 
their studies. While not everyone can draw like Michelangelo or letter like a 
15-th century monk, we all can create handwritten solutions that are organized 
and neat. Toward that end, the following specifications are hereby established
for work submitted in this class:

<ol>
<li> Use standard size 8-1/2" x 11" paper for submitted work; do not use sheets 
	with ragged edges torn from notebooks or recycled paper from another 
	course or someone's old company letterhead.
<li> Start each problem on a new page; print your name and the problem number 
	at the top.
<li> Problem solutions should normally contain a sketch of the object under study, 
	e.g. the circuit. Appropriate quantities should be labeled on the sketch.
<li> Start your solutions from the fundamental laws/concepts, then specialize the 
	general relations for the problem under study, substituting in for the 
	variables that are pertinent to the particular problem.  
<li> All major steps, including substitutions and algebraic simplifications, should 
	be clearly understandable. Don't be afraid to add a few words about how 
	you did things.
<li> While calculators give vast numbers of digits for answers, think about the 
	number of digits that are sufficient and round off appropriately.
<li> Final answers should include appropriate units and be highlighted in an enclosed 
	box or underlined.
</ol>

College instructors normally encourage students to form study groups, and this can 
lead to collaborative solutions. For such cases, however, you should independently 
re-develop your own solution. Directly copying another student's work is a form of 
cheating and can lead to serious consequences as outlined in the URI Student Handbook.
